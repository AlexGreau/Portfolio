          Alexandre is committed to his task, but also eager to learn about the context in which it
          takes place. He is generous in effort, pro-active in communication and meticulous in
          realization. The months during which we've worked together have been a nice human and
          intellectual exchange: I wish him a load of great opportunities :)

          I have collaborated with Alexandre in multiple analytics projects that involved many
          technical touchpoints requiring analytical and problem solving skills, especially when
          developing and testing our analytics library. Alexandre demonstrated his competency in not
          just hard but also soft skills: motivation, curiosity, conscientiousness, and good
          communication with customers. <br />
          On the technical side, he showed his expertise in UI/UX by deploying User-Centered Design
          considerations into his work and bringing them to life with excellent UI development
          skills. Collaborating with Alexandre was pleasant and I recognize his ability to be a
          technical team player who goes beyond codes.

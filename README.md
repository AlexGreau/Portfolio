# Portfolio
Repo dedicated to a digital presentation of me, easy to share and giving a small peek into my skills and personality.  
I chose Vue3 and typescript because it's a stack easily transferrable into my current work (Vue2) : what i learn here can be directly applied to my work and vice-versa.
